# next-assessment
Hello, 

To start the web app,you are required to have Xamppl application. First, you can download the files and put in htdocs folder of Xampp folder. Then, turn on the Xampp application and enter the URL consist of the index file path. As in my case, my url is http://localhost/iss/next-assessment/index.php.

Next, enter your choice of date and time, and hit the submit button as you will be directed to the next page which will show the list of the ISS Location. 

For this assessment, I have done the extension A, as I tried to create a simple UI for the web App. I also did the extension B which to display the location of the ISS. 

Thats all, thank you !
